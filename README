This software provides a way of proxy over Great Firewall of China using socks5.

Here is how the software works:
(1) Web browser sends the request to ProxyC;
(2) PorxyC encrypts the request and sends to ProxyF;
(3) The encryped request goes through the Great Firewall;
(5) ProxyF receives the request, decrypts it and sends to the web server, such as google or baidu;
(6) The web server receives the request, and sends the response to ProxyF;
(7) ProxyF encrypts the response and sends to PorxyC;
(8) The encryped response goes through the Great Firewall;
(6) The ProxyC receives the response, decrypts it and sends to web browser.

You need a linux server out of China on which you run ProxyF. You can get it free on AWS cloud.
Usage: ProxyF Port

You also need a linux server within China on which you run ProxyC. This server can be you local machine, if it is linux.
Usage: ProxyC LocalIP LocalPort RemoteIP RemotePort

To use the proxy in Chrome, you need change the target of Chrome's shortcut to:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" -proxy-server=socks5://192.168.154.128:8080
Here 192.168.154.128 is LocalIP, 8080 is LocalPort.
